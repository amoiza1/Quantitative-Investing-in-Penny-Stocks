Investing in Penny Stocks using Post Market News

Normally markets don't react fully to the news released post market. This news can be tremendous for highly volatile/penny stocks. Using this knowledge, I have create an algorithm to automatically identify penny stocks that might open high during pre-market / market next day. Beware that this strategy is extremely risky and has been tested only in bull market. Please use this as a source of inspiration only.
